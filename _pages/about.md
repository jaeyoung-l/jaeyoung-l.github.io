Hello, Iâ€™m Jaeyoung, currently attending Seoul National University as a Computer Science and Engineering major. I am currently a research intern at [MARS Lab](https://saadiagabriel.com/mars_lab.html), under the guidance of [Dr. Saadia Gabriel](https://saadiagabriel.com/). I am an undergraduate researcher at [MIR Lab](https://mirlab.yonsei.ac.kr/), with [Dr. Youngjae Yu](https://yj-yu.github.io/home/) as my advisor. Before that, I worked as a software engineer for 3 years at [Hyperconnect](https://hyperconnect.com/en/), a company acquired by [Match Group](https://mtch.com/). I worked on developing an AI content moderation system that employed a human-in-the-loop approach.

My research interest goal is to develop effective and reliable AI systems for addressing societal challenges by enhancing models and fostering collaborations with humans.
