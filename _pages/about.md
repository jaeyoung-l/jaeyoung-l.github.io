I'm an undergraduate student at Seoul National University, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am currently doing research on interesting topics in MLLM/LLM, advised by [Saadia Gabriel](https://saadiagabriel.com/) and [Youngjae Yu](https://yj-yu.github.io/home/). Before, I worked as a software engineer for 3 years at [Hyperconnect](https://hyperconnect.com/en/), a company acquired by [Match Group](https://mtch.com/). I mostly worked on developing an AI content moderation system that employed a human-in-the-loop approach.

Lately I've been getting more interested in model interpretability - across various modalities, such as text, image, and audio.
