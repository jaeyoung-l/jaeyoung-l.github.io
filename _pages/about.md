I'm an undergraduate student at Seoul National University, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am currently doing research on interesting topics in MLLM/LLM with [Dr. Saadia Gabriel](https://saadiagabriel.com/).and [Dr. Youngjae Yu](https://yj-yu.github.io/home/) as my advisor. Before, I worked as a software engineer for 3 years at [Hyperconnect](https://hyperconnect.com/en/), a company acquired by [Match Group](https://mtch.com/). I mostly worked on developing an AI content moderation system that employed a human-in-the-loop approach.

My research goal is to develop effective and reliable AI systems for addressing societal challenges by enhancing models and fostering collaborations with humans.
