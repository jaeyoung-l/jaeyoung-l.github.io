Hello, Iâ€™m Jaeyoung, currently attending Seoul National University as a Computer Science and Engineering major. I am currently a research intern at [MARS Lab](https://saadiagabriel.com/mars_lab.html), under the guidance of [Dr. Saadia Gabriel](https://saadiagabriel.com/). Additionally, I collaborate externally with the [NYU College of Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), where Dr. Gabriel also hosts my work. Furthermore, I am an undergraduate researcher at [Yonsei MIR Lab](https://mirlab.yonsei.ac.kr/), with [Dr. Youngjae Yu](https://yj-yu.github.io/home/) as my advisor. Before that, I was a software engineer at Hyperconnect, a company acquired by Match Group. At there, I worked on the development of the human-in-the-loop system for content moderation.

My primary research interests include misinformation detection and LLMs understanding the social value. Recently, I have been working on misinformation detection, especially on improving systems by utilizing knowledge transfer and interventions generated by LLMs.
