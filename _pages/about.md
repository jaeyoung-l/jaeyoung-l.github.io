I am currently working with [Fazl Barez](https://fbarez.github.io/) at the University of Oxford, focusing on automating mechanistic interpretability. I am also broadly interested in interpretability across different modalities.  

I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Seoul National University. I have conducted research on multimodal and large language models (MLLM/LLM), advised by [Saadia Gabriel](https://saadiagabriel.com/) and [Youngjae Yu](https://yj-yu.github.io/home/).  

Previously, I worked as a software engineer for 3 years at [Hyperconnect](https://hyperconnect.com/en/), a company acquired by [Match Group](https://mtch.com/), where I developed an AI content moderation system employing a human-in-the-loop approach.
